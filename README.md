Hi, I’m @mikogoyenechea

I’m currently training to provide LIMS (Laboratory Information Management Systems) application support and development.

I’m interested in learning front-end web development.

Feel free to send me an e-mail to mikogoyenechea@gmail.com or connect with me at LinkedIn. (www.linkedin.com/in/mikhail-goyenechea-689a82125)

Cheers!
